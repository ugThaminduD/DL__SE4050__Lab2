1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

Few nodes (1–2), the model underfits => accuracy is low.
Increase nodes (3–5) => accuracy improves significantly.
Once you go beyond a certain threshold (50–100+), the accuracy doesn’t keep increasing. Instead, it stabilizes and may go up and down a bit. Sometimes, it even drops slightly due to overfitting or training noise.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

When increasing the hidden node from 2 to 3, there is a very noticeable increase in accuracy. Then, plateaus around a maximum accuracy (5 → 50). For very large hidden sizes (100, 200, 300, 400), accuracy just oscillates around the same level, not giving meaningful improvement.
